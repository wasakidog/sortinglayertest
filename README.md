# sortinglayertest
this is a really simple testing relationship between 3D object and 2D object with sorting layer in unity.

I couldn't find a blog about the relationship between sorting layers and 3D objects anywhere, 
and I didn't understand the relationship in the unity manual, so I made this simple test.
